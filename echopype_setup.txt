# Ones it is installed, under the Anaconda3 folder in the Start menu should be a couple of terminal options: 
# Anaconda Powershell Prompt and/or Anaconda Prompt. 
# Select Anaconda Prompt. Then cd to directory with this "environment.yml" file,
# configure the python environment:

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate echopype
jupyter notebook
 
# if the notebook doesn't launch, then you'll need to install the needed notebook packages into the environment 
# and then start the notebook:
 
conda install notebook nb_conda_kernels jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
jupyter notebook
 
# Make sure you are at a level in the directory tree where you can navigate down to the notebook. You can't go up 
# in the directory tree.
